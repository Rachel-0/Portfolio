    "Run the following cell to see a histogram plot. Each colour on the histogram represents a different group since we are using an independant samples t test. Let's pretend these groups are people who cycle to work and people who use a train. The dependant variable could be mood on arrival (positive-negative).\n",

    "Play with the sliders to change the parameters of sample size, mean difference and within-group variance. These are the core components we use to decide if there is a significant difference between two groups. Notice how dinstinguishable the two groups are on the histogram as well as the p value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can be more **confident** that there is a difference between groups when the sample size is greater, and the differences between people within each group (within group variance) is relatively low compared with the difference between each group (the mean difference). In performing the statistical test, we are trying to estimate how much of the overall variance in the sample (differences in mood measured) is due to the different groups, and how much is due to all other factors such as random noise, measurement error or variables that we didn't include in the analysis.\n",
