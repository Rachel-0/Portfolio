          Various UK universities have commisioned this segmentation project.
           Using data from previous applicants who ultimately enroled or didn't enrol,
            the characteristics of groups with various likelihoods of enrolment are described.
             Universities use this insight to target their recruitment efforts.
        </p>
        <h2 class="project-subtitle">Project Overview</h2>
        <p class="about__desc">
          The data provided typically includes a unique applicant ID, academic background,
           demographic variables, home location, application date, and enrolment status 
           (enroled or didn't enrol). These data are first cleaned and then enriched by
            calculating the distance to campus (Haversine distance), and merging the
             Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) with the applicant data on location. 
             This is done using the Geopandas library with a spatial join on applicant postcode (point) 
             and LSOA area (polygon).
             <br> 
        </p>
        <h2 class="project-subtitle">Modelling</h2>
        <p class="about__desc">
          The data are by nature unbalanced because a typical university enrols approximately 20% 
          of applicants. To correct this and improve the accuracy of the model, SMOTE was used 
          to produce dummy data for the learn sample. t tests and chi-square tests were used to
           inform feature selection. The features for which enrolment status had a significant 
           effect were entered into the initial model.Logistic regression was the performed on 
           the learn sample of data using the selected features. Distance to campus followed by 
           age were typically the best predictors of enrolment status. IMD score and a subset 
           of the IMD, education score were often significant predictors in addition.
