        <p class="proj_overview">
          Various UK universities have commisioned this segmentation project.
           Using data from previous applicants who ultimately enroled or didn't enrol,
            the characteristics of groups with various likelihoods of enrolment are described.
             Universities use this insight to target their recruitment efforts.

        <div class="Project_content-container">
          <p class="about__desc_proj_2col">
              The data provided typically includes a unique applicant ID, academic background,
              demographic variables, home location, application date, and enrolment status
              (enrolled or didn't enroll). These data are first cleaned which usually involves
              deduplicating rows, handling null values, checking variable distributions and proportions,
              using NLP techniques to clean and validate applicant postcodes.
              <br>
              <br> The data are then enriched by
              geolocating the home address, calculating the distance to campus (Haversine distance),
              and merging the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) with the applicant data on location.
              This is done using the Geopandas library with a spatial join on applicant postcode (point)
              and LSOA area (polygon).

        <h2 class="project-subtitle">Modelling</h2>
        <p class="about__desc_proj">
          The data are by nature unbalanced because a typical university enrols approximately 20% 
          of applicants. To correct this and improve the accuracy of the model, SMOTE was used 
          to produce dummy data for the training sample following an 80-20 train lest split.
           t tests and chi-square tests were used to
           inform feature selection. The features for which enrolment status had a significant 
           effect were entered into the initial model. Logistic regression was the performed on 
           the training sample of data using the selected features. The Statsmodels library was used. 
           Distance to campus followed by 
           age were typically the best predictors of enrolment status. IMD score and a subset 
           of the IMD, education score were often significant predictors in addition.
           <br>
           <br> A final model was selected based on the F1 score in the regression while 
           looking for a balance between precision and recall, and by observing the confusion matrix.
           Multicolinearity was avoided by selecting variables with minimal or no correlation.
           The model was then applied to the original dataset (without SMOTE) in order to calculate 
          the predicted probability that each applicant would enrol. For the purpose of this 
          project it was important to observe a non-binary distribution of predicted probabilities.
          This allows for applicants to be grouped by enrolment likelihood, for sufficient quantity 
          in each group, and for these groups to be demarcated. A total of four segmentation groups
          was considered a practical number to allow universities to make business decisions.

        <h2 class="project-subtitle">Conclusion</h2>
        <p class="about__desc_proj">
          This analysis was performed separately for clearing applicants and for each faculty,
          campus and level of study the university required, subject to sample size. For some clients,
           the impact of covid was also assessed.
          Descriptive statistics of each segmented group were presented to the university
          along with expert domain business advice from my colleauges. This included competitor 
          market share for these applicants, advice on entry requirements, and advice on how to 
          use these findings to target marketing efforts based on location and messaging.
